It was an usual Friday evening until I found out that I have left the umbrella in a cornermost lecture room in the last floor. 
I knew for sure that even if I would have a magical power to keep myself not getting wet amidst the heavy rain, there is no way that I could escape from my mother who was anxiously waiting the umbrella to return home.
Blaming Mr. Marcus for not winding up the lecture on time, I started walking along the narrow corridor which leads to the staircase.                                   You are not alone                                                                                                        
I could hear anything other than my own footsteps. I was calm and quit until I found out that I was walking slower than the footsteps which I earlier thought to be my own.Suddenly I heard a sound behind me. I was so scared at that time and I turned back to wathch that what I heard behind me.As I thought there was a laidy who is wearing a white saree and taking a baby. I was shoked and screem. And also I ran so fast to my home without looking back.


There was a girl who was playing in the park when she saw a picture in the bush. She kept the photo, but forgot about it until she was married. Her husband asked, who is that little boy in the wallet. She answered "My first love." Then the husband smailed and said,"I lost this picture when I was nine years old."
